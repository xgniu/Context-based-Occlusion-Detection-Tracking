# Context-based Occlusion Detection
This is the code for paper:
Xiaoguang Niu and Yu Qiao, “Context-based occlusion detection for robust visual tracking,” in IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, 2017, pp.3655–3659.
In the paper we use DSST[1] as the baseline tracker, but in this code we adopt SAMF[2] as the baseline tracker.
